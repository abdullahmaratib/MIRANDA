<p>I developed the official website for MIRANDA using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GSAP to create a fully unique and engaging user experience. The site features creative animations that bring the brandâ€™s identity to life, offering a modern and interactive interface.

Using GSAP, I added smooth transitions and dynamic elements to enhance the visual appeal and user interaction. The design is responsive and optimized for various devices, ensuring accessibility and fluidity across different screen sizes. This project highlights my skills in both design and animation.</p>
